This project is a simple plugin for WordPress that allows the user to embed content stored in a CMIS-compliant content repository into a WordPress site.  Right now it is only tested against Alfresco, but this will change as the project matures.  Some features include:

  * Content mime-type detection for the display of the right type of icon for certain doc formats.
  * Folder navigation
  * Display of the current location in the repository

Feature requests are always welcome, as are code contributions.
